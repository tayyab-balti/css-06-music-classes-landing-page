- **Hero Section:** Prominent section for "Music Classes" with a title, descriptive text, and a strong call-to-action button.
- **Asymmetrical Design:** Utilization of large, colored geometric shapes (yellow circles and squares) to create a dynamic, engaging layout.
- **Image Integration:** Seamlessly integrated images showcasing children interacting with musical instruments.
- **Content Blocks:** Detailed sections for program facts and the school's "Our Story."
